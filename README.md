# what is your problem?
## üôã person :
* I want to eat a safe meal in a place with fewer people. 
* I visited several restaurants in person to find a restaurant with few people.
* It takes a lot of time to find a restaurant with fewer people.
* I always use the map app to use the visitor trend service in the restaurant, but not accurate.

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ restaurant owners :
* Sales plunge to Covid19. 
* There are online food services such as delivery, but I don't capture the same sales as before.
* Inventory should be thrown away because there are few customers.
* If there is a confirmed case in the store, I have to shut down our business, so I'm so worried about safety.

## üè¢ Company : 
* We were hit by sales with Covid19, which feel burdened by operating expenses. 
* If there is a confirmed case among employees, we should be shut down, so they should live a safe life.
* Employees are looking for restaurants with fewer people, so they don't start working even after lunch.

# Why *[Bok Jak]*
- McKinsey & Company's survey shows that Corona 19 has reduced meals in restaurants by 49%.
